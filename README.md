## Project Motivation 

One of the primary motivations for tracking the daily cases and deaths of COVID-19 in China is to better understand the impact of the virus on public health, especially given that the first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Accurate and timely reporting of data can help policymakers make informed decisions about how to allocate resources and respond to outbreaks, as well as help researchers study the virus and its impact. Furthermore, tracking those data can help promote transparency, both within China and internationally, as there are several international affairs happened recently about the heated topic Covid-19. 


*The brief questions answered by this dashboard would be:* 
- What is the daily cases and deaths of China in certain date?   
- What is the overall trend of the covid pandemic in China?  
- How has the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in China affected the daily case and death counts?
- How is the number of daily cases and deaths of China compared to the world?
